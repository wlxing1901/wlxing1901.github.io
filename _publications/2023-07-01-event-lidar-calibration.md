This paper proposes a novel method to calibrate the extrinsic parameters between an event camera and a LiDAR without the need for a calibration board or other equipment. The approach leverages the fact that when an event camera is in motion, changes in reflectivity and geometric edges in the environment trigger numerous events, which can also be captured by LiDAR. The method extracts edges from events and point clouds and correlates them to estimate extrinsic parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is highly robust and effective in various scenes, both indoor and outdoor, with complex geometry and random surface textures in various lighting conditions.
